# Kickstaring with Excel

## Overview of Project
In this project, data was analyzed from 'Kickstarter Campaigns' to find trends in the time a campaign was launched, and the funding goals of the campaign to help a  client best determine a pathway to a successful campaign.

### Purpoose
The main purpose was to identify trends in the date a campaign was launched, and the fundraising goals to see waht influence they may have had on a campaign being successful or failing to complete.

## Analysis
### Theater Outcomes Based on Luanch Date
Campaigns launches starting in between March and April and maintained high success rates peaking in May. They declined slowly until october when they dropped off hit the low for the year. Failed campaigns stayed steady with the most failed campaigns peaking in may and again in October. Septmeber/ October seems to be the time when campaigns struggled the most. The spring saw the mnost launched campaigns over all, and the widest margin of successful campaigns to failed campaigns.

### Outcomes Based on Fudnraising Goals
Campaigns for Plays whose goals were under $1,000 had the highest success rate of nearly 80%. As fundraising goals went up, success rates fell bottoming out at 20% success when goals were between $25,000 and $30,000. Success rates did go up from there and plateau fromk $35,00 to $45,000 and then declined to sub 20% from there on.

## Challenges
The mopst significant challenge was determining which sets of data influence the success of a campaign. There are plenty of trends to analyze and determinging which one would be the most general and apply to all campaigns, yet specific enough to show a strong correlation of campaign success. These challenges were overcome by selecting timing and fundraising goals. These were general enough to apply to all campaigns and determine potential quality of the experinece of the cammpaign. Essentially the weather when the campaigns would take place, and the funding available for the campaign. 

## Results
- The Spring/ Summer time showed the highest successful theater campaigns. This is likely due to the weather when people are willing to go out to theaters. Spring Break adn Summer vacation couild also be an influencial factor since kids will be out of school.  
- It seems campaigns with lower budgets were easier to launch successfully. Success of campaigns progressivley went down as goals went up. The spike at the upper end may signal more funding for higher end productions.
- This dataset only shows the relation of Play's outcomes based on launch date, and fundrtaising goals of all tyoes of campaigns. A line chart of fundraising goals of only plays would be more representative, or a line chart of launch date of all campaign types would also paiunt a more clear picture. A line chart showing successful campaigns (filterable by caampaign type) vs the amount of backers would also be useful to show the interest levels the communities had in those campaigns.

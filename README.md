# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
The data from Kickstarter campaigns was analyzed to uncover trends such as timing of campaign, and fuding to determine the optimal parameters to run a campaign that would ultimately be successful.
##Findings based on timing of campaigns concluded thefollowing:
-Months April - June saw the largest amount of successful campaigns. The successful campaign trend fell noticably after May through June. This was copmplimented a large amount of failed campaigns taking place between July and October. it should be noted that canceled campaigns spiked in July as well.

## Findings of Kickstarter categories is as follows:
-Theater and Musical categories saw the most success in the data set. There were substantialy more successfull campaigns in these categories than the rest of the categories analyzed. They also had a higher ratio of successful to failed campaigns compared to the other categories (it is worth mentioning that film and video saw a similar ration, with a smaller number of successful campaigns over all).

## Suggestions:
Using the trends identified in the data and information abouve, my suggestions are as follows:
The ideal time to run a campaing would be mid to late April. Theater and Musical campaigns seem to have the most success as a whole, and would be the best bet. Determine interest in your campaign ahead of time and identify enough backers. This would ideally be in the range of 60+ supporters. A goal of $5,000 is reasonable though not seemingly necessary. This woould be more than enough to cover your expenses given plenty of campaigns succeeded with less than half of that amount in funding.
